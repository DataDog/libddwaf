# Implementation notes for bindings


## `ddwaf_handle`

`ddwaf_handle` represents a rule set, with associated rule data, exclusions,
and so on. It is created through `ddwaf_init` and `ddwaf_update`.

A tracer will want to keep only one live `ddwaf_handle`. The first one will be
created through `ddwaf_init`, and then it will replace it through
`ddwaf_update` as it gets new configurations through remote config.

The two relevant operations on `ddwaf_handle` are `ddwaf_context_init` and
`ddwaf_update`. Neither of these operations changes the `ddwaf_handle`. So, at
this point, it is sufficient to ensure that threads calling
`ddwaf_context_init` and `ddwaf_update` see a fully constructed `ddwaf_handle`
â€” put in other words, it is sufficient that the write to the pointer/reference
happens after `ddwaf_init/update` is called (as seen by other threads). For
this, a release-acquire operation suffices:

```c++
std::atomic<ddwaf_handle> cur_ddwaf_handle; // global variable; the live handle

// Initialization thread
void initialize_handle(
    const ddwaf_object *ruleset, const ddwaf_config *config, ddwaf_object *diagnostics)
{
    ddwaf_handle new_handle = ddwaf_init(ruleset, config, diagnostics);
    if (new_handle == nullptr) { /* handle error */}
    cur_ddwaf_handle.store(new_handle, std::memory_order_release);
}

// Request thread
ddwaf_context create_context() {
    ddwaf_handle handle = cur_ddwaf_handle.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
    if (handle == nullptr) { /* handle error */ }
    return ddwaf_context_init(handle);
}
```

However, there is a potential problem when you update the live handle. While
libddwaf refcounts the `ddwaf_handle` and ensures that its memory is not
reclaimed until all associated `ddwaf_context`s have been destroyed, it cannot
prevent a use-after-free in this situation:

```c++
// Remote config thread
void update_handle(const ddwaf_object *ruleset, ddwaf_object *diagnostics)
{
    ddwaf_handle old_handle = cur_ddwaf_handle.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
    ddwaf_handle new_handle = ddwaf_update(old_handle, ruleset, diagnostics);
    cur_ddwaf_handle.store(new_handle, std::memory_order_release);

    // will free the memory if no ddwaf_contexts are associated with it:
    ddwaf_destroy(old_handle);
}

// Request thread
ddwaf_context create_context() {
    ddwaf_handle handle = cur_ddwaf_handle.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
    if (handle == nullptr) { /* handle error */ }
    // XXX: the handle fetched may have been destroyed in the interim
    return ddwaf_context_init(handle);
}
```

That is, the old `ddwaf_handle` can only be destroyed once we can be guaranteed
that no other thread will try to create a new context from it (or update it
through `ddwaf_update`, though that is less of a problem because generally the
tracers will not want to update the global `ddwaf_handle` from several threads
simultaneously).

There are many possible strategies to deal with this memory reclamation
problem, but the most straightforward are:

* If the runtime uses garbage collection, we can delay the call to
  `ddwaf_destroy` until the garbage collector determines the object wrapping
  the native `ddwaf_handle` has no more references. This is relatively easy to
  do and doesn't involve extra usage of locks, but the memory used by the
  `ddwaf_handle` will not be available until the garbage collector decides
  to reclaim the wrapped object. Because the garbage collector does not see
  the memory being used by the `ddwaf_handle`, if garbage collection never
  happens, there is a risk that memory consumption gets too high. This is a
  rather unlikely scenario though.

* You can use read-write locks:

```c++
// global variables
std::shared_mutex mutex;
ddwaf_handle cur_ddwaf_handle;

// Initialization thread
void initialize_handle(
    const ddwaf_object *ruleset, const ddwaf_config *config, ddwaf_object *diagnostics)
{
    ddwaf_handle new_handle = ddwaf_init(ruleset, config, diagnostics);
    if (new_handle == nullptr) { /* handle error */}

    std::unique_lock lock{mutex}; // acquire write lock
    cur_ddwaf_handle = new_handle;
    // write lock released on return
}

// Remote config thread
void update_handle(const ddwaf_object *ruleset, ddwaf_object *diagnostics)
{
    std::unique_lock lock{mutex}; // acquire write lock
    ddwaf_handle old_handle = cur_ddwaf_handle.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
    ddwaf_handle new_handle = ddwaf_update(old_handle, ruleset, diagnostics);
    cur_ddwaf_handle = new_handle;
    ddwaf_destroy(old_handle);
    // write lock released on return
}

// Request thread
ddwaf_context create_context() {
    std::shared_lock lock{mutex}; // acquire read lock
    if (cur_ddwaf_handle == nullptr) { /* handle error */ }
    return ddwaf_context_init(cur_ddwaf_handle);
    // read lock released on return
}
```

## `ddwaf_context`

On the other hand, `ddwaf_context` is not thread-safe. If a `ddwaf_context` is
used by multiple threads (in web servers where the processing of the request
can move between several threads, or happen in several threads simultaneously),
you need to use locks so that calls to `ddwaf_run/destroy` are not run
concurrently, and that changes made to the `ddwaf_context` in one thread through
`ddwaf_run/destroy` are visible to the other threads subsequently run
`ddwaf_run/destroy` on the same context. You also need to ensure that no calls
to `ddwaf_run/destroy` happen after `ddwaf_destroy` is called.

```c++
// each request will have one of these associated with it
struct ctx_wrapper {
    std::mutex mutex;
    ddwaf_context ctx;
};

DDWAF_RET_CODE run_waf(
    ctx_wrapper &wrapper, ddwaf_object *data, ddwaf_object *result, uint64_t timeout)
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock{wrapper.mutex}; // acquire exclusive lock
    if (wrapper.ctx == nullptr) { /* context already destroyed */ }
    return ddwaf_run(wrapper.ctx, data, result, timeout);
    // lock is released on return
}

void destroy_ctx(ctx_wrapper &wrapper) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock{wrapper.mutex};
    if (wrapper.ctx == nullptr) { /* context already destroyed */ }
    ddwaf_context_destroy(wrapper.ctx);
    wrapper.ctx = nullptr;
}
```
